# About the project
This project provides sample code to build ‘Mojo Finder’ Android App using Mojo APIs.  
Mojo Finder App allows a user to search and locate a user/device with the following inputs:

- Device Name
- Username
- MAC Address

The user’s location access is limited to her role.

# Purpose
